# Telegramm-Bot-for-study-support
Inspirated by my friend (Rassul Kuspan), while he was searching for clients to start teaching(coaching) in Prague in telegramm chats
In Prague telegramm chats there are so much irrelevant information, like selling, renting, advertisments etc.
And sometimes it's really hard to find smth what u need.
What are the benefits of using such a bot:
  0)Easy to use, type a name, university, course and question cheack the information and create the order, order accepts by teacher in 1 click
  1)Teachers don't waste time on searching for students
  2)Students don't waste time on searching for teacher
  3)Teacher will know all the information before he accept the order (University, Subject Course, Questions),
  that means, teacher will be prepared and student will be sure, that this teacher can answer all the questions about the course,, without wasting time
  4)No databases/files to store the data, full anonimity, If teacher accepts the order, Student will have @username of Teacher and vice versa.
  this preventing to clean the DB, restart bot and etc.(manual work), that means that u can start the bot and forget about it :), while it's helping all the users if it.
  5)It's open for all telegramm users, so we are not centralizing in Prague only, it can be used in many other countires(#todo language choose, teacher groups of countries)
