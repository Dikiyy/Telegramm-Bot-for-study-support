# Telegramm-Bot-for-study-support
To create such a bot, i was inspired by my friend: Rassul Kuspan
Bot that was created to facilitate the process of finding teachers and students for coaching/teaching in Prague through Telegram chats. The bot is designed to filter out irrelevant information and allow for easy communication between teachers and students. The benefits of using the bot include saving time and ensuring that the teacher is prepared and capable of answering the student's questions. The bot is also anonymous, and there is no need to store any data or manually clean any databases. It is open for all Telegram users and can be used in other countries as well.
